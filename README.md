# Hey there, I'm Julian 👋  

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Machine Learning & HCI.  
I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that merge **machine learning, biomechanics, and full-stack engineering**—from research-grade models to enterprise software.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On  

- **At Model Health (ML Intern)**  
  Delivering lab-grade exercise metrics from smartphone video to clinics and enterprise customers (e.g., Adidas). Training **LSTMs/Transformers** on bench press datasets, adding **object tracking** for upper-body estimation, and building an **automated ML pipeline** for exercise recognition.  

- **At Auctor (Software Engineering Intern)**  
  Shipped **user persona and task generation features** for design artifact creation using **Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL**.  
  Architected a **diagram generation system powered by LLMs** with ReactFlow and multi-modal RAG; built agentic workflows with subagent tool-call routing for NLP-based iterative edits.  
  Served **20+ enterprise/F500 customers**, grew ARR **70% MoM**, and helped raise **$4M seed funding from Sequoia Capital**.  

- **At CMU Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab (Research Assistant)**  
  Built an open-source **web app for IMU-based joint kinematics** with 3D playback via Three.js, deployed alongside a paper under review at *PNAS*.  
  Created a **quaternion-based skeleton visualizer** to assess computer vision tracking methods for human motion.
