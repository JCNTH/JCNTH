## üöÄ What I'm Currently Working On  

- **At Model Health üèãÔ∏è (ML Intern)**  
  Delivering lab-grade exercise metrics from smartphone video to clinics and enterprise customers (e.g., Adidas). Training **LSTMs/Transformers** on bench press datasets, adding **object tracking** for upper-body estimation, and building an **automated ML pipeline** for exercise recognition.  

- **At CMU Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab (Research Assistant)**  
  Building an open-source **web app for IMU-based joint kinematics** with 3D playback via Three.js, deployed alongside a paper under review at *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*.  
  Created a **quaternion-based skeleton visualizer** to assess computer vision tracking methods for human motion.

## üïë Past Experiences

- **Auctor (Software Engineering Intern)**  
  Shipped **user persona and task generation features** for design artifact creation using **Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL**. Architected a **diagram generation system powered by LLMs** with ReactFlow and multi-modal RAG; built agentic workflows with subagent tool-call routing for NLP-based iterative edits.  

- **Stanford Health Care (ML/Software Intern)**  
  Developed **FastFax**, an AI-enabled triage system for urgent faxed referrals.  Built a CNN + OpenCV pipeline to detect ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù checkboxes, achieving 89% precision on >567k faxes. Deployed at Stanford Health Care.
